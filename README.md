Marin Balabanov

This is an exercise project for a fictional global event management company. This web application enables users to see all available events, and - if they are logged in - to edit and delete them. 

These are the data fields available for each event:
- Event’s name
- Event’s date and start time
- Event’s description
- Event’s image (link to the image)
- Event’s capacity (number of persons)
- Event’s contact e-mail
- Event’s contact phone number
- Event’s address (physical location, including street name and number, ZIP code and city name)
- Event’s URL
- Event’s Type (predefined list like “music”, “sport”, “movie”, “theater” etc.).

The exercise is modeled on the official website of WienTourismus: https://events.wien.info/en/

The repository contains a DB with example items at: https://github.com/mbalabanov/CFLMS-MarinBalabanov-CodeReview-13/blob/main/db-export/cr13_marinbalabanov_bigevents.sql
